\subsection{Second-Order Processes}

\begin{defn}{Second-Order Process}{}
    Let \( X = (X_{n} )_{n\in \mathbb{Z} } \) be a stochastic process on a probability space \( (\Omega ,\mathcal{F},P) \). The process \( X \) is said to be a (discrete-time) second-order process if it has finite second moments \( \mathbb{E} |X_{n} |^{2} < \infty  \) for all \( n \in \mathbb{Z}  \). Since all \( X_{n}  \) are elements of \( L^2(\Omega ,\mathcal{F} ,P) \), it follows that second-order processes also form a vector space. 
\end{defn}

\begin{exmp}{}{}
    Gaussian processes are second-order processes, and the collection of Gaussian processes is a subspace of second-order processes.
\end{exmp}

\begin{defn}{Second-Order Statistics}{}
For second-order processes \( X \) and \( Y \) the second-order statistics are summarized by the mean function \( \mu _{X} (n) \coloneqq \mathbb{E} [X_{n} ] \) and covariance function
\[
    R_{XY} (m,n) \coloneqq \mathrm{Cov} (X_{m} ,Y_{n} ), \ \ m,n \in \mathbb{Z} .
\]
For second-order processes, the mean and covariance functions are finite everywhere.
\end{defn}
\begin{exmp}{}{}
    If $X$ is a Gaussian process, then all finite-dimensional marginals
    are characterized by the functions $\mu_ X$ and $R_{XX} $.
\end{exmp}

\begin{defn}{Wide Sense Stationary}{}
A second-order process \( X = (X_{n} )_{n\in \mathbb{Z} }  \) is wide sense stationary (WSS), if \( \mu _{x} (n) = \mu _{X} (0)\) for all \( n \), and \( R_{XX}(m,n)  \) is a function of only the difference $(m-n)$. In this case, we often abbreviate \( R_{X  X}(m,n) \) as \( R_{X X}(m - n) \) to denote parametrization of the covariance function by the difference \( (m - n) \). 
\end{defn}

\begin{rmk}{}{}
For WSS processes the covariance enjoys the follow symmetries:
\[
    R_{XX} (n,n + k) = R_{X X}(0,k) = R_{X X}(k, 0) = R _{X X}(0,- k).
\]
In our compact notation, \( R_{X X}(k)= R_{X X}(-k) \), so that \(  R_{X X} \) is a symmetric function of \( k \). 
\end{rmk}

\begin{defn}{Jointly Wide Senese Stationary}{}
    Processes \( X = (X_{n} )_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}  \) and \( Y = (Y_{n} )_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \) are jointly wide sense stationary (JWSS) if each are WSS and the covariance function \( R_{XY} (m,n) = \mathrm{Cov} (X_{m}, Y_{n} )\) depends only on the difference \( m - n \). In this case, we abbreviate \( R_{XY} (m,n) \) as \( R_{XY}(m - n)  \). 

\end{defn}
\begin{rmk}{}{}
    Unlike \( R_{X X} \), the function \( R_{XY} \) is not symmetric in its argument. However, if \( X \) and \( Y \) are JWSS, then we do have the following identities
    \[
        R_{XY} (n + k, n) = \mathrm{Cov} (X_{k} , Y_0) = \mathrm{Cov} (X_{0} , Y_ {- k} ) = R_{XY}(k,0) = R_{XY} (0,- k).  
    \]
    In particular, noting the order of subscripts, we have \( R_{XY} (k) = R_{YX} (- k) \). 
\end{rmk}

\subsection{Spectral Theory of Second-Order Processes}


\subsubsection{Fourier transform speedrun}
To start, we note some info and results about Fourier transforms. 

\begin{misc}{About \( l^p \) spaces }{}
We write \( x\in l^p(\mathbb{Z} ) \) if \( x \) is a real-valued sequence \( (x(n))_{n \in \mathbb{Z} } \subset \mathbb{R}  \) satisfying \( \lVert x \rVert _p \coloneqq \left( \sum_{n} \left\lvert x(n)^P \right\rvert  \right)^\frac{1}{p} < \infty  \), with \( \lVert x \rVert _ \infty \coloneqq \sup _n\left\lvert x(n) \right\rvert  \). For \( 1\leq p\leq q \leq \infty  \), \( l^p(\mathbb{Z} ) \) is complete with respect to convergence in its norm \( \lVert \cdot  \rVert  \), and \( l^p(\mathbb{Z} )\subset l^q(\mathbb{Z} ) \) on account of \( \lVert x \rVert _q \leq  \lVert x \rVert _p \). The spaces \( l^p(\mathbb{Z} ) \)  are equal to the closure of \( l^1(\mathbb{Z} ) \). Of particular note, \( l^2(\mathbb{X} ) \) is a Hilbert space when equipped with the inner product
\[
    (x,y) \mapsto \sum_{n} x(n)y(n), \ \ x,y \in l^2(\mathbb{Z} ). 
\]
\end{misc}

\begin{defn}{Discrete-time Fourier Transform}{}
For a sequence \( x \in l^1(\mathbb{Z} ) \), its discrete-time Fourier transform is defined as the complex-valued function 
\[
    \hat{x} (\omega ) = \sum_{n} x(n)e^{-i \omega n}, \ \ \omega \in [- \pi ,\pi ).
\]
Note that the mapping \( x \mapsto \hat{x} \) is a linear transformation from \( l^1(\mathbb{Z} )\) to  the function space 
\[
    L^{\infty} ([-\pi, \pi ))\coloneqq \left\{ f:[- \pi ,\pi )\to \mathbb{C};  \ \sup _\omega |f(\omega )|< \infty   \right\}. 
\]

This leads to the Fourier inversion identity 
\[
    x(n) = \frac{1}{2\pi } \int_{- \pi }^{\pi } \hat{x} (\omega )e^{i \omega n}  \,d \omega  = \sum_{k} x(k)\delta (n - k) , \ \ n \in  \mathbb{Z}. 
\]

This formula holds if \( \hat{x}  \) is the Fourier transform of \( x\in l^2(\mathbb{Z} ) \). 



\end{defn}

\begin{thrm}{Convolution theorem for Fourier transforms}{}
If \( x,y \in l^2(\mathbb{Z} ) \) and \( \mathrm{ess}\sup (\left\lvert \hat{y}  \right\rvert ) < \infty  \), then their convolution \( z = x \ast y \) is in \( l^2(\mathbb{Z} ) \). In particular, all Fourier transforms exist and satisfy 
\[
    \hat{z} = \hat{x} \hat{y} . 
\]
\end{thrm}



\begin{misc}{Parseval identity}{}
If \( x,y \in l^1(\mathbb{Z} ) \), we have the easily verified Parseval identity
\[
    \sum_{n} x(n)y(n) = \frac{1}{2\pi }\int_{- \pi }^{\pi} \hat{x} (\omega )\hat{y} ^{\ast}(\omega )   \,d \omega  .
\]

In particular, this implies that the mapping \( x\mapsto \hat{x}   \) is a linear isometry from \( l^2(\mathbb{Z} ) \cap l^1 (\mathbb{Z} ) \) into \( L^2([-\pi, \pi )) \); i.e., 
\[
    \lVert x \rVert _2 = \lVert \hat{x}  \rVert _{L^2} \text{ for all } x \in  l^1(\mathbb{Z} ),
\] where \( \lVert \cdot  \rVert_{L^2}  \) denotes the norm on \( L^2([- \pi ,\pi )) \) induced by its inner product. 
\end{misc}


\begin{defn}{Impulse response}{}
    If \( x \) is input to a LTI system with impulse response \( g \), then the output sequence \( y \) is defined by the convolution 
    \[
        y(n) = (x \ast g)(n) = \sum_{k} x(n - k)g(k), \ \ n \in \mathbb{Z} ,
    \]
    provided the series converges. 
    \end{defn}
    
\begin{defn}{Frequence response}{}
An LTI system with impulse response \( g \in l^2(\mathbb{Z} ) \) is equivalently characterized by its frequency response \( G \), which is simply the Fourier transform of the impulse response:
\[
    G(\omega ) = \sum_{n} g(n)e^{- i \omega n}, \ \ \omega \in [- \pi , \pi ). 
\]
\end{defn}    
\begin{rmk}{}{}
    By convolution theorem, if a finite-energy sequence \( x \) (i.e., \( x\in l^2(\mathbb{Z} ) \)) is input to a stable (i.e. BIBO stability) LTI system with impulse response \( g \), the output \( y \) will also have finite energy, and is characterized by its Fourier transform
    \[
        \hat{y} = G \hat{x},
    \]
    where \( \hat{x}  \) denotes the Fourier transform of the input \( x \). 
\end{rmk}

Now back to section 5.2.



\begin{defn}{Energy Spectral Density}{}
Given \( x \in l^1(\mathbb{Z} )  \), we can define a sequence \( a \in l^1(\mathbb{Z} ) \) via the self-convolution 
\[
    a(n) = \sum_{k} x(k)x(n - k),  \ \ n \in \mathbb{Z}. 
\]
By the convolution theorem and time-reversal property of Fourier transforms, the discrete-time Fourier transform of \( a \) is equal to 
\[
    \hat{a} (\omega ) = \hat{x} (\omega )\hat{x} ^{\ast} (\omega ) = |\hat{x} (\omega )| ^{2} \geq 0. 
\]
The function \( \hat{a}  \) is called the energy spectral density of \( x \), since it is a nonnegative function with the property that its integral over any subset of frequencies in \( [- \pi , \pi ) \) is equal to the energy of the sequence \( x \) restricted to those frequencies. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Power Spectral Density}{}
    The average energy normalized by time is called power. Assume we are working with a zero-mean WSS random process. 
    \[
        \frac{1}{2N + 1} \mathbb{E} [A_{N} (\omega )] = \frac{1}{2N + 1} \sum_{- N\leq m,n \leq N } \mathbb{E} [X_{n} X_{m} ] e^{-i \omega (n - m)}  = \sum_{k = - 2N}^{2N} R_{XX}(k) e^{-i \omega k}\left( 1 - \frac{\left\lvert k \right\rvert }{2N + 1}  \right)    . 
    \]
    Now, if \( R_{ X X} \in l^1(\mathbb{Z} ) \), then the limit as \( N \to  \infty \) exists on the right by dominated convergence, so that 
    \[
        S_{X X} (\omega )\coloneqq \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{2N + 1}\mathbb{E} [A_{N} (\omega )] = \sum_{k}R_{X X}(k) e^{- j \omega k}, \ \ \omega \in [- \pi ,\pi ).  
    \]
    The function \( S_{X X} \) is called the power spectral density of the process \( X \), and is a real, non-negative function. The definition of power spectral density can be extended to WSS processes \( X \) with \( R_{X X} \in  l^2(\mathbb{Z} ) \) using the mean-square convergence of the Fourier transform. In this case, \( S_{X X} \) continues to be real and non-negative. 
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}{Regular covariance}{}
We say that \( X \) admits a regular covariance if: (i) \( R_{X X } \in l^2(\mathbb{Z} ) \); and (ii) there exists \( \lambda >0 \) such that the power spectral density satisfies
\[
    \lambda \leq \mathrm{ess}\inf (S_{XX}) \leq \mathrm{ess}\sup (S_{XX}) \leq \lambda ^{-1} . 
\]
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Cross-power spectrum}{}
If \( X \) is a random variable with finite variance and \( Y = (Y_{n} )_{n \in \mathbb{Z} } \) is zero-mean WSS process, then the cross-power spectrum is defined via the discrete-time Fourier transform
\[
    S_{YX}(\omega ) \coloneqq \sum_{n} \mathbb{E} [XY_{n} ]e^{-i \omega n} , \ \ \omega \in [- \pi ,\pi ),
\] 
provided the series converges in a suitable sense (e.g., if \( n \mapsto \mathbb{E} [XY_{n} ] \) is in \( l^2(\mathbb{Z})  \), then series converges in the mean-square sense).

Note the order of subscripts. If \( X = (X_{n} )_{n \in\mathbb{Z} } \) is JWSS with \( Y \), we define 
\[
    S_{YX}(\omega ) \coloneqq \sum_{n} \mathbb{E} [X_0 Y_{n} ]e^{-i \omega n};
\]
i.e., \( S_{YX}  \) is the Fourier transform of \( R_{YX}  \), consistent with the definition of power spectral density. In this case, the quantity \( S_{XY}  \) is also well-defined (as the Fourier transform of \( R_{XY}  \)), and enjoys the conjugate symmetry \( S_{XY }= S^{\ast} _{YX}  \). 
\end{defn}
